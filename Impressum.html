    <h2>Liability for Content</h2>
    <p>
        As a service provider, I am responsible for my own content on this website according to the general laws as per Section 7(1) of the Telemedia Act (TMG). However, I am not obligated to monitor third-party information transmitted or stored, nor am I required to investigate circumstances that suggest illegal activity, as specified in Sections 8 to 10 of the TMG.

    <h2>Liability for Links</h2>
    <p>
        This website contains links to external third-party websites. I have no influence over the content of these external sites, and therefore cannot assume responsibility for their content. The respective providers or operators of these linked pages are solely responsible for the content. At the time of linking, no illegal content was detected on the linked pages. A permanent content control of the linked sites is, however, not feasible without concrete indications of a legal violation. Upon becoming aware of any legal violations, I will promptly remove such links.

        The content and works created by the operator of this site are protected by German copyright law. Reproduction, editing, distribution, and any other form of exploitation outside the limits of copyright law require the written consent of the respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of this site are only permitted for personal, non-commercial use. As far as the contents of this site are not created by the operator, the copyrights of third parties are respected. Third-party content is always marked as such. If you become aware of a copyright violation, please let me know. Upon becoming aware of any legal violations, I will promptly remove such content.
